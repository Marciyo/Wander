Project is missing GoogleService-Info.plist and GMSApiKey in Info.plist due to security reasons. 

When we release the version we will add those files locally. 
If you want to run the app for yourself, you have to set up the firebase. 
Contact us for more details on how to do that at galileo@wanderapp.eu
